# Advanced-CNN-Models
It includes Advanced CNN models like Neural Style Transfer (NST), Object Detection using YOLO and Face Recognition via Siamese networks 

These models are very Deep Convolution Neural Network Models that also take the use of Transfer Learning.
- Keras Framework is used to develop the model for ease in Backpropagation.
